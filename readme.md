# ðŸ’§ Aqua-AI V2

Aqua-AI V2 is an AI-powered web application built with Streamlit that helps intelligently monitor water consumption by detecting whether a person is holding a water bottle in front of a webcam.

The app uses a machine learning model from Hugging Face called **DETR (DEtection TRansformer)** to detect objects in a video stream in real-time. It highlights detected objects like a person and a bottle with bounding boxes.
