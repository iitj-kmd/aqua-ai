# ðŸ’§ Aqua-AI 

Aqua-AI V2 is an AI-powered web application built with Streamlit that helps intelligently monitor water consumption by detecting whether a person is holding a water bottle in front of a webcam.

The app uses a machine learning model from Hugging Face called **DETR (DEtection TRansformer)** to detect objects in a video stream in real-time. It highlights detected objects like a person and a bottle with bounding boxes.


**Aqua-AI V4** is a new version of the Aqua-AI project that uses a **native YOLO object detection model** built entirely with OpenCV and PyTorch â€” instead of relying on Hugging Face models.

This version detects whether a person is holding a water bottle in front of a webcam, helping promote healthy water consumption habits.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Differences from V2

âœ… Uses **native YOLO** (e.g. YOLOv5 or YOLOv8)  
âœ… Runs locally without internet after installing weights  
âœ… Faster inference speed compared to large transformers  
âœ… Smooth video which is not attainable in streamlit UI
âœ… Fully integrated with:
- **OpenCV** for image handling and bounding boxes
- **PyTorch** for running YOLO model
-

## Project Purpose

âœ… Monitor hydration habits  for family members 
âœ… Encourage people to drink water regularly
